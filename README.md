# tensorboard-writer Rust bindings

Simple APIs to write *event files* that can be read by TensorBoard.

See Rustdoc or the `examples/` directory for details.

## License

Several files here are pulled from TensorBoard, which is licensed under
Apache-2.0. (All of those files are either generated or I was the one who
originally wrote them, but Apache-2.0 is still a reasonable, conservative
interpretation.)
